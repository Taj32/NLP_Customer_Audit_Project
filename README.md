# Customer Satisfaction Analytics System

This project aims to build a customer auditing analytics system that captures real-world conversations between staff and customers, analyzes the context and emotion behind those conversations, and presents insights through a simple dashboard. The goal is to help small and medium-sized businesses understand and improve customer experience by tying natural language feedback directly to business outcomes.
